#Syncano User Registration Mini Hack

This minihack is designed to show you how easy user management can be with Syncano. First, you'll want to clone this repo.

`git clone http://github.com/twack05/syncano-user-reg`

`cd syncano-user-reg`

`npm install`

Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice. Here, we have a simple User Registration form with input fields for username and password. The page is already wired up with JQuery and Syncano, but it's up to you to make this form work successfully! You'll have to sign up for [Syncano](http://syncano.io) if you haven't already. I've also included a link to our User Management Docs on the index page to help you.

To successfully, complete this mini-hack. Write the Javascript code necessary to allow the form to successfully create users. You'll be able to see these created users in the Syncano Dashboard under "Users". Once completed, swing by the Syncano booth to show us your working form! Completing one mini-hack gets you a free Syncano t-shirt. Completing 3 enters you into a drawing for a big prize! If you are one of the first 5 people to complete all 5 Syncano Mini-Hacks, we have a special prize for you!
